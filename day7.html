                I've decided to participate in the <span class="hashtag">#100DaysOfCode</span> trend on <a href="https://twitter.com/"
                    target="_blank">Twitter</a>
                as a result of the quarantine imposed during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019"
                    target="_blank">COVID-19</a>
                pandemic. I think I will be using this page as a reference point to when I started and to measure the
                development of my ability.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been using lessons from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>
                and as of
                today have completed the 'Basic HTML' and 'Basic CSS' portions. From hereon forward, I will be updating
                future iterations of this page with new skills I learn to implement in addition to side (main?)
                projects to practice said skills.
                <hr>
            </p>

            <p>
                Thinking ahead, for ease of future access and navigation I plan to either implement a task bar or
                banner along the top or one side of the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                A top banner offers several benefits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Retains a sense of uniformity across different mediums (web vs mobile) as I feel side banners take
                    up valuable horizontal space on mobile and I usually find them cumbersome.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Allows a quick cursory glance at the page and contains everthing a visitor would need to quickly
                    navigate elsewhere.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As I currently envision this project to be a progress journal of sorts, I feel a side banner as a type
                of table of contents can be where other iterations of the page are linked. I could even include links
                to other projects all in one general area for better QoL for myself/visitors.

                I had a late start to coding today because of other committments. I am halfway through the 'Applied
                Visual Design' portion and I plan to apply some of the concepts in that section to my existing divs.

            <p>
                Today I've decided to create a github repository and begin uploading each day's work onto github. I did
                not originally think of uploading into github so I had to copy my original files into the location that
                my repository was saved in locally.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used solely terminal command line to clone my repository and add/commit files, but I relied on the
                trusty copy/paste for moving the original files as was not yet sure of my ability to move files across
                directories using command line.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a bit annoying that I have to scroll down everytime I want to see my updates on the browser so I'm
                strongly considering shifting the format of this journal to reverse chronological order.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, I could also forego this current scrolling journal format and use on in which the entire
                page is dedicated to that day's work.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I personally prefer the current iteration because when I eventually have enough entries, it'll
                        be aesthetically pleasing to scroll and see the changes rather than clicking through multiple
                        webpages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Instead of literally coding in reverse order, I'm hoping I will learn something that will allow
                        the process to be automated and the entries displayed reverse chronologically behind the scenes
                        between text editor and browser.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Perhaps something as simple as taking each entry as an element in an array list and
                                then rendered in reverse order when displayed. I am not sure if this is a thing in web
                                development.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                I am finally applying some of the features I mentioned on <a href="#april23" target="_blank">April 23rd</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Made some QoL change to earlier links making them open in new tabs rather than redirecting within the
                current page.

                    I am thinking of implementing a to-do list of sorts to keep track of changes that I plan to enact

                    the journal.
                </li>

                    Items will be colored red to signify a feature in progress and green for a completed feature.

                <li>
                    Items will contain a link that can guide the visitor to its completion date to see the
                    progress or from the completed item to see what spurred the feature into existance.

                    This section in particular will be tentatively colored yellow, to highlight that it was a
                    major change -- until I can think of another method to display such, otherwise.

            <hr>
            <p class="monument">
                Just as I was reviewing today's work I realized I skipped a day, likely due to League induced
                time/reality disassociation. Today is actually Day 5, not Day 4 like the html title and file name would
                have you suggest.
            </p>
            <p class="monument">
                Instead of making changes that reflect the corrected date and such on this iteration, I've decided not
                to as documentation of my mistake.
            </p>
            <p class="monument">
                The accurate real-time notation will be used in tomorrow's iteration along with a corresponding

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The file name as well as html title are now in coordination with real-time accuracy.

                <li>
                    I've made a few aesthetic changes to the way tasks in progress are first initialized and defined
                    for clarity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I added a class called "tasks" on each of the items on my to do list before I took a nap and I now
                    no longer remember why.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Minor change, but I commented out the entry template that was previously on the bottom.

                <li>
                    The top navigation bar is now fixed in place and can be accessed at all times when scrolling. In
                    making this change, I also added a margin to the page so the content doesn't hug the borders and to
                    prevent overlapping with the navigation bar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Separated the navigation bar into two sections, the general left portion and the right portion with
                    my socials.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Renamed the 'Directory' to 'Journal'.

            </ul>
            <p class="monument">
                I should specify on my commit that I made a clerical error on the dating for clarity on github.

            <p class="monument">
                I've decided a small format change: the daily changes to the document will be listed as an unordered
                list following the date.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    This will improve readability for days when there were a lot of changes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creates a uniformity in what is expected to be seen when looking at the content of an entry.

                    Now that the journal has a sizable length that allows scrolling, I'm thinking of implementing a

                I'm planning to make this page an exclusive journal page and begin creating respective pages accoring

                    <li>
                        I initially made this change so I can enact an anchor active property to my navigation bar, but
                        it will also allow me to practice other web dev skills not suitable for a journal page such as
                        forms and larger animations.
