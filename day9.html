            <p>
                I've decided to participate in the <span class="hashtag">#100DaysOfCode</span> trend on <a href="https://twitter.com/"
                    target="_blank">Twitter</a>
                as a result of the quarantine imposed during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019"
                    target="_blank">COVID-19</a>
                pandemic. I think I will be using this page as a reference point to when I started and to measure the
                development of my ability.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been using lessons from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>
                and as of
                today have completed the 'Basic HTML' and 'Basic CSS' portions. From hereon forward, I will be updating
                future iterations of this page with new skills I learn to implement in addition to side (main?)
                projects to practice said skills.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Thinking ahead, for ease of future access and navigation I plan to either implement a task bar or
                banner along the top or one side of the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                A top banner offers several benefits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Retains a sense of uniformity across different mediums (web vs mobile) as I feel side banners take
                    up valuable horizontal space on mobile and I usually find them cumbersome.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Allows a quick cursory glance at the page and contains everthing a visitor would need to quickly
                    navigate elsewhere.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As I currently envision this project to be a progress journal of sorts, I feel a side banner as a type
                of table of contents can be where other iterations of the page are linked. I could even include links
                to other projects all in one general area for better QoL for myself/visitors.

                I had a late start to coding today because of other committments. I am halfway through the 'Applied
                Visual Design' portion and I plan to apply some of the concepts in that section to my existing divs.

            <p>
                Today I've decided to create a github repository and begin uploading each day's work onto github. I did
                not originally think of uploading into github so I had to copy my original files into the location that
                my repository was saved in locally.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used solely terminal command line to clone my repository and add/commit files, but I relied on the
                trusty copy/paste for moving the original files as was not yet sure of my ability to move files across
                directories using command line.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a bit annoying that I have to scroll down everytime I want to see my updates on the browser so I'm
                strongly considering shifting the format of this journal to reverse chronological order.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, I could also forego this current scrolling journal format and use on in which the entire
                page is dedicated to that day's work.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I personally prefer the current iteration because when I eventually have enough entries, it'll
                    be aesthetically pleasing to scroll and see the changes rather than clicking through multiple
                    webpages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Instead of literally coding in reverse order, I'm hoping I will learn something that will allow
                    the process to be automated and the entries displayed reverse chronologically behind the scenes
                    between text editor and browser.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Perhaps something as simple as taking each entry as an element in an array list and
                            then rendered in reverse order when displayed. I am not sure if this is a thing in web
                            development.
                        </li>

                I am finally applying some of the features I mentioned on <a href="#april23" target="_blank">April 23rd</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Made some QoL change to earlier links making them open in new tabs rather than redirecting within the
                current page.

                    I am thinking of implementing a to-do list of sorts to keep track of changes that I plan to enact
                    on
                    the journal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Items will be colored red to signify a feature in progress and green for a completed feature.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Items will contain a link that can guide the visitor to its completion date to see the
                    progress or from the completed item to see what spurred the feature into existance.

                    This section in particular will be tentatively colored yellow, to highlight that it was a
                    major change -- until I can think of another method to display such, otherwise.

            <p class="monument">
                Just as I was reviewing today's work I realized I skipped a day, likely due to League induced
                time/reality disassociation. Today is actually Day 5, not Day 4 like the html title and file name would
                have you suggest.
            </p>
            <p class="monument">
                Instead of making changes that reflect the corrected date and such on this iteration, I've decided not
                to as documentation of my mistake.
            </p>
            <p class="monument">
                The accurate real-time notation will be used in tomorrow's iteration along with a corresponding
                disclosure.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The file name as well as html title are now in coordination with real-time accuracy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I've made a few aesthetic changes to the way tasks in progress are first initialized and defined
                    for clarity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I added a class called "tasks" on each of the items on my to do list before I took a nap and I now
                    no longer remember why.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Minor change, but I commented out the entry template that was previously on the bottom.

                <li class="monument">
                    The top navigation bar is now fixed in place and can be accessed at all times when scrolling. In
                    making this change, I also added a margin to the page so the content doesn't hug the borders and to
                    prevent overlapping with the navigation bar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Separated the navigation bar into two sections, the general left portion and the right portion with
                    my socials.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Renamed the 'Directory' to 'Journal'.

            </ul>
            <p class="monument">
                I should specify on my commit that I made a clerical error on the dating for clarity on github.
            </p>
            <p class="monument">
                I've decided a small format change: the daily changes to the document will be listed as an unordered
                list following the date.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This will improve readability for days when there were a lot of changes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creates a uniformity in what is expected to be seen when looking at the content of an entry.

                    Now that the journal has a sizable length that allows scrolling, I'm thinking of implementing a
                    sidebar directory which links to each day for easy navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There will also be links items on the to do list. The link destination will then contain the first
                    instance where the item was initialized and contains the explanantion behind the creation of the
                    item. Further clicking on the item will lead to the date when the item was completed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="monument">
                I'm planning to make this page an exclusive journal page and begin creating respective pages accoring

                    I initially made this change so I can enact an anchor active property to my navigation bar, but
                    it will also allow me to practice other web dev skills not suitable for a journal page such as
                    forms and larger animations.

                    Changed the code of the navigation bar to allow an easier implementation of an active property.
                    This change should also make it easier to add icons later.

                    I have removed the task class from existing to do list items as I will be using it in the creation
                    for the Sidebar Directory.

                    Fixed problem in which in-page anchor links were being overlayed by the fixed border. Solution:
                    applying padding on top of each in
                    page anchor.

                I considered creating the Home, Projects, and Contact pages today, but I'm going to save them for when
                I have new features I want to try to implement.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Doing so would allow me to refresh how to build a page from the ground up and at least 3 more
                    chances to help me be more familiar with the process.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am also thinking of using one giant page with the current extra pages as sections of the
                    page, instead.

                        <li>
                            I'm rather fond of the active property and I'm not sure how compatible it will be with
                            a one-page design.

                    Interested in applying @keyframes animations on certain sections of my page.

            <ul>

                    Sidebar can be implemented as a drop down menu under 'Journal'.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Clicking 'Journal' from the nav bar would still nagivate to the first journal entry.

                    <li>
                        The dropdown would allow for quicker navigation within the journal section to a specific
                        date/feature.

                    I have temporarily stopped updating the sidebar in anticipation of a total page redesign.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Updated the main navigation bar to be nested within a nav tag.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added a copyright footer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Updated my header tags to follow the Applied Accessibility standards of hierarchical content
                    relationships. Font discrepancies stylized with CSS.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Updated divs to elements that add semantic meaning to the markup. Tags include main, header,
                    footer, nav,
                    article, and section.

                Tommorrow I plan to start making structural changes that will bring the aesthetic of the page closer to
                my desired one page vision.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The greater Journal area will need a section tag, and so will the other page sections.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There will be an internal anchor tag in the Projects section that will lead to the Journal section as a show of my work and thought processes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The class "entryFull" needs an article tag.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I will likely be moving the Journal section after the Contact section. This should reduce the amount of scrolling needed to reach the
                Contact section and allow more flexibility with the customization of the Journal section.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use the header tag to hold navigation links for the Journal section that are currently held in the sidebar directory.
